        we will get back packets which may have some zeroes on the end (of course this is OK bc length is
        in IP header - TODO: need to fix this though ugh
      ALSO NOTE: will have to say that in pinfo, we store SOME list which includes the valid packet (with
        length specified in IP header) along with additional extra garbage data (we could say zeroes)
      then in FEC, will have to say that lengths = length for present packet, length >= length for missing packet
        say that if we do this (in decoder_list_correct), get original data except some missing data may be
        padded with zeroes. We will have to go into IP bytes to find correct length*)
