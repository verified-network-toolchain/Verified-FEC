This folder contains the source code for the error-correction system, developed by Bellcore (now Peraton Labs). See the root README and the C file headers for license info.

`orig` contains the original code, while `modified` contains an altered version, with the following changes:
- Debug and logging information is removed.
- The changes described in Section 7 of "Specifying and Verifying a Real-World Packet Error-Correction System" are made, with appropriate comments. 
- The IP struct no longer uses bitfields, since VST does not support these.

The folders `orig/mini-prod3/fecActuator` and `modified/mini-prod3/fecActuator` contain the main code; `redFecActuator.c` is the Producer, 
`blackFecActuator.c` is the Consumer, and `fec.c` is the core Reed-Solomon error-correcting code implementation.

We also include the `.v` files generated by `clightgen`, which compiles the code with CompCert to produce a Clight AST for the programs in question.
These ASTs can be verified with VST.
